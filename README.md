## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** 

My learning was focused on clean HTML code paired with CSS.

## Optimizations

When I improve this project I will add behavorability via Javascript, add a booking portal, a carousel of the images on the homepage, and enable the search button.

## Lessons Learned:

Separations of concern. Starting simple in HTML. Using HTML to build up the CSS. Responsiveness and flexbox in CSS.
